Model K
=======

The model T was a famous car built in a centralised way by exploiting workers; let's design the model K: a crowdsourced design for a one-person comfortable pod in which one can lean back, relax, have a drink dispenser on the side, 
place for your favourite vape so you don't loose it all the time, room for modules with the paraphernalia of your faviourite vices, a nice big screen or VR headset, for the ultimate splat-and-not-move experience. Air purified + 
cooled/heated + controlled hygrometry, control of the air flow speed, possible perfume dispenser, lighting, sound insulated, ergonomic seating that fits your body like a glove, everything to make this your little bubble where you 
have total control over one or two cubic metres of nature and turn them into your own little personalised paradise.

Possible improvements would be the K2 or K3, designed for 2 or 3 people to lounge within, comfortably

This project is just a wish, if I do spend a bit of time on it I'll upload designs here, all my code & designs will be in the public domain (CC0 license) so that anyone can improve it and contribute as they wish.
